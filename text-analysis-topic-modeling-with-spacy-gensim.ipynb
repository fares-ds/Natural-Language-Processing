In this case of text data, this means attempting to discover clusters of documents, grouped by topic. A very important idea to keep in mind here is that we don’t know the correct topic or the right answer! All we know is that the documents clustered together share similar topic ideas. It is up to us to identify what these topics represent.\n","\n","---\n","# 📑 Text Analysis Tutorial\n","\n","> Our steps, naturally, are setting up our imports.
